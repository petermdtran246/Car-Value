# Car Value

I. Overview:

This GitHub repository contains the solution for the "Car Value (Classes)" lab assignment. The goal of this lab was to complete the implementation of the Car class by adding an attribute purchase_price (integer type) and implementing the print_info() method to output the car's information, including the model year, purchase price, and current value.

II. Files Included:

This Python file contains the implementation of the Car class. It includes the init() method to initialize the class attributes, the calc_current_value() method to calculate the current value of the car based on depreciation, and the print_info() method to print the car's information.
